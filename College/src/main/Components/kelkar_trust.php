                        <p class="my-6 text-xl text-gray-700">Keeping in view the Objectives of the Trust, the Late Shri Govind Damodar fondly referred to as Bhausaheb Kelkar established the V.G. Vaze College of Arts, Science, and Commerce at Mithagar Road, Mulund (E) Mumbai-81 on 20th June 1984. He created well-equipped laboratories for undergraduate courses and state-of-the-art laboratories for research and development.</p>
                        <p class="my-6 text-xl text-gray-700">The Scientific Research Center was subsequently established. The Trust promotes Research by encouraging the faculty to engage in research activities including higher degrees as also to guide students who wish to do M.Phils and PhDs. The Advanced Chemistry Laboratory and Instrumentation Center were added in due course of time to expand the scope of scientific activities.</p>
